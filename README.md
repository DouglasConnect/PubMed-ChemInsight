# ‚öõÔ∏è PubMed ChemInsight: Unlock Insights from PubMed

**PubMed ChemInsight** is an intuitive, Streamlit-based application tailored for researchers to efficiently retrieve and analyze scientific literature related to their compounds of interest. The tool enables comprehensive querying of PubMed by combining specified compounds with relevant interaction targets, and allows the inclusion of custom keywords to refine search results, highlight specific interactions, or explore particular relationships. This streamlined approach helps researchers quickly access relevant studies, enhancing their ability to draw meaningful insights from the scientific literature.

## Features

- **Flexible Input Options:** Enter multiple compounds and genes of interest. Additionally, specify keywords to refine the search.
- **Automated Synonym Matching:** Automatically finds the most common synonyms for each compound to broaden the search.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Search articles within a specified year range.
- **Comprehensive Data Handling:** Filters duplicate results and handles missing or inconsistent data.
- **CSV Export:** Export search results to CSV for further analysis.

## How It Works

The app leverages several key technologies and data sources to retrieve relevant PubMed articles:

- **PubMed Integration:** Uses the NCBI PubMed API to fetch article metadata based on input criteria.
- **PubChem Synonym Finder:** Retrieves common synonyms for the input compounds from PubChem to expand the search.
- **Streamlit:** Provides a clean and interactive user interface for input, configuration, and output visualization.
- **Data Processing:** Combines and filters articles using Pandas to ensure accuracy and avoid duplicate entries.

## Installation

### Option 1: Local Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/pubmed-retriever.git
   cd pubmed-retriever
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the App:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Option 2: Running with Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t pubmed-retriever .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8501:8501 pubmed-retriever
   ```

3. **Access the App:**  
   Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to view and interact with the application.

## Usage

1. **Start the Application:** Open a terminal and run `streamlit run app.py` locally or launch the Docker container.
2. **Input Section:** 
   - **Compounds:** Enter compounds, each on a separate line.
   - **Genes:** (Optional) Enter genes, each on a separate line.
   - **Additional Keywords:** (Optional) Provide keywords to refine the search.
3. **Configuration:** Use the sidebar to configure various settings like the number of top synonyms per compound, date range, and number of articles to retrieve.
4. **Launch the Search:** Click on **"üöÄ Launch Search"** to start the retrieval process.
5. **View and Export Results:** After processing, results will be displayed in a tabular format. You can export individual compound results or the combined results to CSV.

## Docker Setup

The Dockerfile provided in this repository allows you to build and run the application in a containerized environment. Follow the steps below to use Docker:

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t pubmed-retriever .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8501:8501 pubmed-retriever
   ```

3. **Access the App:**  
   Go to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

### Dockerfile Overview

The Dockerfile uses a slim Python 3.9 base image and performs the following steps:

- Sets up a working directory.
- Copies the application code to the container.
- Installs the required Python packages.
- Exposes port `8501` for the Streamlit app.
- Runs the app on container startup using the Streamlit command.
